What is Bios interrupt services ?
Even without an operating system, we use BIOS interrupts to communicate with hardware.

A BIOS interrupt service is a set of ready-made commands provided by the BIOS to make it easier for programmers to access hardware.
Direct access to hardware is difficult.
Each graphics card and each keyboard may operate differently.

The BIOS standardizes these devices.
The programmer only calls the interrupt number without modification.

Question 1:
To read the keyboard → INT 16h (Keyboard Service)

To write to the screen → INT 10h (Video Service)
Screen output interrupt is the BIOS service used for programs to print something on the screen, change the screen mode, or display characters/graphics.

For disk operations → INT 13h (Disk Service)
Disk interrupt refers to the BIOS service used to directly access the computer’s disk drives.

When the computer starts, even before the operating system is loaded, it can read the keyboard and write to the screen (it does not need an operating system).


Question 2:
CS (Code Segment) → Holds the beginning of the code segment.

IP (Instruction Pointer) → Holds the offset address of the next instruction to be executed.

DS (Data Segment) → Holds the base address of the data segment.

ES (Extra Segment) → The second data segment used for additional data operations.

AX (Accumulator Register) → The main accumulator register used in arithmetic and input/output operations.

BX (Base Register) → Used as the base register for addressing and indexing.

Question 3:
INT 10h (BIOS Video Services) → Provided by the BIOS for hardware-level screen/video operations.

INT 21h (DOS Services) → Provides operating system (DOS) services such as file, keyboard, memory, screen, etc.

In short: INT 10h is at the hardware level, INT 21h is at the operating system level.

Question 4:
Display a character using BIOS  :  INT 10h, Function 0Eh
Read keystroke using BIOS  :  INT 16h, Function 00h
Print a string using DOS   :  INT 21h, Function 09h



Question 5:
a) BIOS accesses the hardware directly; it communicates directly with physical devices such as the graphics card, disk controller, and keyboard controller.
DOS, on the other hand, uses the hardware through the BIOS; it manages higher-level operations such as the file system, keyboard buffer, and screen output.

b) In real mode, the physical address is calculated with the following formula:

Physical Address = Segment × 16 + Offset

c) The processor looks at the interrupt vector table and goes to the service routine defined for INT 21h.

From the DOS service table, it executes the relevant service according to the function number in the AH register (e.g., file operation, screen printing, string reading, etc.).

When the task is finished, the CPU returns to its previous position.
